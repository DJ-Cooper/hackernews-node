PROCESS:
1. Extend GraphQL schema definition with a new root field
    (and data types)
2. Implement resolver functions for added fields 

typeDefs
defines GraphQL schema

resolvers
implementation of GraphQL schema

Every resolver function receives 4 input args.
    parent: result of previous resolver execution level
        (nested curly brace levels)

On the first level, invokes 'feed' resolver & returns
data stored in 'links'. For 2nd level, server invokes 
resolvers of Link type, inferred from schema.
Because the implementation of Link resolvers is trivial,
they can be omitted.

The implementation of the 'post' resolver first creates
a new 'link' object, then adds it to the existing 
'links' list and final returns the new link.
